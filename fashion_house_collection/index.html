              The event was a success, and we realized good ideas can come from anyone, anywhere,
              at any time. They also realized there were many others who wanted to support good
              ideas. So they left the Bank to launch the worldâ€™s first crowdfunding
              community in 2002. Today, people in more than 165 countries can easily share their
              ideas, and individual donors and companies can easily support vetted nonprofits.
